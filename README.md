ELGAMO-MIDTERM PROJECT

Features Implemented
- Added a typewriter animation effect on my name "Jerealain" using JavaScript to make home page feel fun and engaging.

- Applied a hover effect with the color lilac on the navigation icons to improve usability and visual feedback. Same as the social media icons but with a white hover effect for contrast and visibility over the background.

- The footer is now fixed in position, staying visible across all sections while scrolling. This is to avoid repeating the same icons in multiple sections like the Home and Contact page, so might as well apply this for a cleaner interface and have easy access to social links at any time.

- Used a darker, semi-transparent background in the About section. This is to visually separate content, enhance readability, and help user identify that they are in a new section of the website.
